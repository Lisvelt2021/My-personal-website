  <p>This website will have a variety of things. My main focus on this website will be to
  feature different pictures that I have taken over the year. I have been taking
  pictures for about 5 years. I've always liked who photos were able to look with or
  without having to do any editing to it. These photos will sometimes be about
my friends and family but it will mainly be nature pictures. With the photos I will also be putting
in some quotes that are very known by some people.</p>
