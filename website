        <p>On this website there is going to be a variety of photos that I have taken with popular quotes on them. Some of the photos 
        that are going to be on here will not have a quote in them it'll just be the photo that I have taken, or the quote will be 
        beside the photo shown on this website. Keep scrolling down to see lots of original photos and popular quotes. </P>
